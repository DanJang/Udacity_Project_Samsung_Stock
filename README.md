- Because it is R code, the rmd document was converted to a pdf file.  

Main focus here is the ratio of Samsung's value against total value of Korea stock market over time. During the exploration, there were other interesting findings not just the shape of the ratio plot. One thing most impressive is that the ratio could become a guide for investors because certain cycle was detected and the ratio pattern preceded ahead of the price.
